### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- ChatGPT

### What I learned

That i still need more practice with css layout

### Continued development

I'll continue on in the learning path and try and get more of an understanding of css grid next time. I will also continue practicing css in general as i find that more difficult than setting up the the html structure
